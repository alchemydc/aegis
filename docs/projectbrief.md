# Overview
Aegis is an ad-blocker for AI products, starting with chatgpt.com

# MVP capabilities
Browser plug-in that detects and neutralizes advertising on https://chatgpt.com

# Marketing website
This will be built out first, describing the rationale for the product and simple (mocked up) install instructions.

## Technical assumptions
The marketing website will be built using Javascript and Vite.  We are open to suggestions on which frameworks to use beyond that (next.js, react, etc.)
The look and feel of the website is critical. It should be modern, responsive and uncluttered.
